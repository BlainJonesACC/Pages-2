<p>A local biologist needs a program to predict population growth. The inputs would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The initial number of organisms, as an <strong>int</strong></li>
  <li>The rate of growth (a real number greater than 1), as a <strong>float</strong></li>
  <li>The number of hours it takes to achieve this rate, as an <strong>int</strong></li>
  <li>A number of hours during which the population grows, as an <strong>int</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, one might start with a population of 500 organisms, a growth rate of 2, and a growth period to achieve this rate of 6 hours. Assuming that none of the organisms die, this would imply that this population would double in size every 6 hours. Thus, after allowing 6 hours for growth, we would have 1000 organisms, and after 12 hours, we would have 2000 organisms.</p>

<p>Write a program that takes these inputs and displays a prediction of the total population.</p>

<p>An example of the program input and output is shown below:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Enter the initial number of organisms: 10
Enter the rate of growth [a real number &gt; 1]: 2
Enter the number of hours to achieve the rate of growth: 2
Enter the total hours of growth: 6

The total population is 80
</code></pre></div></div>
