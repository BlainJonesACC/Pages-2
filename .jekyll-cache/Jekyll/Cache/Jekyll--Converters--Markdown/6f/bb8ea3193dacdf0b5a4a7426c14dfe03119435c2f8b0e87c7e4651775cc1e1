<p>The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, A and B, is the largest number that can be evenly divided into both of them. Euclidâ€™s algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. You can use this algorithm in the following manner:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number.</li>
  <li>Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process until the smaller number is zero.</li>
</ol>

<p>The larger number at this point is the GCD of A and B. Write a program that lets the user enter two integers and then prints each step in the process of using the Euclidean algorithm to find their GCD.</p>

<p>An example of the program input and output is shown below:</p>

Enter the larger number: 15

The greatest common divisor is 5
</code></pre></div></div>
