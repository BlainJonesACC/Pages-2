## Instructions

Light travels at 3 × 108 meters per second. A light-year is the distance a light beam travels in one year.

Write a program that calculates and displays the value of a light-year.

Useful facts:

- Seconds in a year = 365×24×60<sup>2</sup>
- Rate = 3×10<sup>8</sup> meters per second

Below is an example of the correct output format:

```text
Light travels X meters in a year.
```

### Flowchart

### Starter Code

```python
"""
Program: lightyear.py
Project 2.8

Compute the distance that light travels in a year.

Useful facts:
   rate = 3 * 10 ** 8 meters per second
   seconds in a year = 365 * 24 * 60 ** 2

"""

# Compute the result

# Display the result
```
