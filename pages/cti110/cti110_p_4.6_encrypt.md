## Instructions

Use the strategy of the decimal to binary conversion implemented in Project 4.4, and the bit shift left operation defined in Project 4.5 to code a new encryption algorithm.

The algorithm should

- Add 1 to each characterâ€™s numeric ASCII value.
- Convert it to a bit string.
- Shift the bits of this string one place to the left.

A single-space character in the encrypted string separates the resulting bit strings.

An example of the program input and output is shown below:

```text
Enter a message: Hello world!

0010011 1001101 1011011 1011011 1100001 000011 1110001 1100001 1100111 1011011 1001011 000101
```

### Starter Code

```python
"""
File: encrypt.py
Probject 4.6

Encypts an input string of characters and prints
the result.
"""

# Prompt user to enter a message

# Initialize variable to store encrypted text

# iterate

    # Add 1 to ASCII value

    # Convert to binary



    # Shift one bit to left

    # Add encrypted character to code string
    
```

{% include links.html %}
