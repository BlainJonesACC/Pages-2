## Program: payroll.py

### Instructions

The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period in a text file. The format of each line of the file is the following: 
**\<last name> \<hours worked> \<hourly wage>**

Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period.

- The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header.

- Each line should contain:
  - An employeeâ€™s name
  - The hours worked
  - The wages paid for that period.

An example of the program input and output is shown below:

```text
Enter the file name: data.txt

Name            Hours      Total Pay
Lambert            34         357.00
Osborne            22         137.50
Giacometti          5         503.50
```
