## Instructions

Write a program that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle as inputs. The program output should indicate whether or not the triangle is a right triangle.

Recall from the Pythagorean theorem that in a right triangle, the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Use The triangle is a right triangle. and The triangle is not a right triangle. as your final outputs.
An example of the program input and proper output format is shown below:

```text
Enter the first side : 3
Enter the second side: 4
Enter the third side : 5

The triangle is a right triangle.
```

>Any of the three sides of the triangle could be the hypotenuse. The program should handle this appropriately.
