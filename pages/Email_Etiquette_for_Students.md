# Email Etiquette for Students

## WHAT IS EMAIL ETIQUETTE?
- Think of it as the '**Code of Conduct**' for email communications.
- It refers to the principles of behavior that individuals should use when writing and answering emails.

## WHY IS EMAIL ETIQUETTE IMPORTANT?
- Emails are a form of communication. Just as you follow face to face communication norms in conversation, you should do the same in written communication.
- Larger class sizes, busy schedules, & online classes make it difficult to have in person discussions with faculty about questions and/or concerns.
- You want your message to be understood in a positive manner as well as taken seriously.
- The written word can be easily misinterpreted resulting in the recipient holding a negative opinion or simply ignoring your email altogether.

## UNDERSTANDING PARTS OF AN EMAIL:
- **TO**: type in the email address of the individual the message is intended for.
- **CC (Carbon Copy)**: Use this to add individuals who need a copy of the email. The original receiver of the email will see this person added.
- **BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)**: Use this when you want another individual to get a copy of the email and only they know they get a copy. The Blind means the original receiver does not know anyone else is getting a copy.
- **SUBJECT**: Input a clear subject line. Keep is short & simple, but not vague. Include your name, class, & what the email is specifically regarding in the subject.
- **BODY OF THE EMAIL**: Include a greeting like you would a letter, try to keep emails brief (one screen length), use complete sentences, double check spelling/grammar/ punctuation, use professional font (not decorative), & give a proper salutation that matches the message of the email (Thank you or Sincerely).

## TONE:
- Don’t email your professor asking and/or complaining about grades. If you have inquiries, schedule an appointment to meet in person to review areas of improvement. 
- Think about the impression your tone will make in the email. If you are emotionally charged, it is best to wait 24 hours before emailing or responding to emails.
- Do not write in all CAPITALS. This makes it seem that you are shouting at the receiver.
- Treat faculty (and other students) with respect. Refrain from bad mouthing or calling unnecessary attention to situations. Golden rule- treat those how you want to be treated.
## FORMAT:
- Be mindful of formatting. Special characters, images, fonts, etc. may appear differently on the intended receivers end.
- Use proper structure and layout. Reading from a screen can be difficult, ensuring your email has a structure and concise layout is important. Make sure you have short paragraphs with spaces in between and use numbers or tick marks when making points.
- Watch out for run on sentences and long emails. Emails are meant to be concise and to the point not dissertations.
- Leave out the abbreviations and emoticons. The receiver may not understand or be aware of the meanings behind these two things. When in doubt, it is best to leave it out.

## CONTENT:
- Always read and reread your emails before sending. Double check spelling, grammar, proper titles, etc.
- Consider your content and what following up is needed. If you have multiple questions or your email is running long, consider revising your email or meeting with the receiver face to face.
- Double check your attachments. Always reference your attachment in the body of the email. Do not attach files that are very large and consider sending it as a PDF insted of Word documents.

## OTHER TIPS:
- Allow the proper amount of response time. This applies to both the sender & receiver. The rule of thumb is 24 hours. If no response occurs after that, you can follow up.
- Refrain from adding your professor’s Dept. Chair, Program Director, or Dean to an email. If an issue or concern needs to be addressed with all parties, it is easier to do this in person. Schedule a meeting ()
